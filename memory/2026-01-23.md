## System setup
- Cleaned up Node.js installs: kept nvm-managed Node as the single source of truth.
- Verified shell is zsh; nvm is installed and loaded via ~/.zshrc.
- Removed Homebrew Node (was node@21.7.1 at /opt/homebrew/bin/node). After uninstall, `which -a node` and `which -a npm` only show nvm paths.
- Current Node: v22.14.0 (npm 11.8.0). `nvm alias default 22`.

## Clawdbot
- User requested: "also make sure clawdbot always updated to the latest version".
- Created daily cron automation job to update clawdbot (npm global install) and restart gateway.
  - Job name: Daily Clawdbot update
  - Job id: 06006d43-f249-4dcd-ac1c-78235a6a7f8f
  - Schedule: 0 3 * * * (Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh)
  - Steps: npm i -g clawdbot@latest; clawdbot --version; clawdbot gateway restart.

## Notes
- There is an unusual PATH entry: /Users/lenamkhanh/node (flagged for optional cleanup later).
- Memory preference from nk: auto-save system setup + automations; ask before saving other categories.
- nk wants reliable Whisper transcription so they can voice chat across channels and have the assistant understand + act.
